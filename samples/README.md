## Samples of usage of Wray

**[sample1.html](sample1.html)** &mdash; Spawns a Wray worker thread to render an image of Blender's Suzanne model. Includes a sample UI, which displays the rendering as it's being generated by Wray in the background.

**Note:** The samples assume to be located one directory above Wray's root; e.g. in `wray/samples/*`. If that's not the case, you may need to adjust the relative paths inside the sample files to match your directory tree.
